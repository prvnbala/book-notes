Anything worth doing is difficult at first.
There is no failure, only trying.

Questions:
why file.read() doesn't return same value when run multiple times.
    this is because, there seems to be a cursor which is moved to the end of file
	when reading it. use file.seek(0) to rewind the cursor back to the start of 
	the file to re-read it. 

Study tip: 
Ex 22: Go back through every exercise and write down all the symbols used.
	   Write next to it, what it does. If you don't know search about it.
	   Once list is ready, rewrite the list and double-check if it is correct.
	   Memorize it for a couple of days before stepping up. 
	   
	   Once memorized, write a table of symbols and description from memory. 
	   If forgot something, go back and memorize. 

Todo: 
Revise the ex22 notes. 
Read code from github, bitbucket, etc.
Create a game story script and code it :) This really seems exciting. 
	   
Notes:
Ex 20 -> could be new to Y.


Ex 43:
Process for OOP - 'top down' approach:

	1. Write or draw about the problem
	2. Extract key concepts from #1 and research them
	3. Create a class hierarchy and object map for the concepts
	4. Code the classes and a test to run them
	5. Repeat and refine

Write or draw about the problem.
Take the nouns and write down the class hierarchy.
Then take the verbs and put as functions into those class hierarchy.
Repeat the process, till more and more clarity is achieved.

Write a skeleton code with just class name and function names
