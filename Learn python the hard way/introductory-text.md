Anything worth doing is difficult at first.
There is no failure, only trying.

Questions:
why file.read() doesn't return same value when run multiple times.
    this is because, there seems to be a cursor which is moved to the end of file
	when reading it. use file.seek(0) to rewind the cursor back to the start of 
	the file to re-read it. 

Study tip: 
Ex 22: Go back through every exercise and write down all the symbols used.
	   Write next to it, what it does. If you don't know search about it.
	   Once list is ready, rewrite the list and double-check if it is correct.
	   Memorize it for a couple of days before stepping up. 
	   
	   Once memorized, write a table of symbols and description from memory. 
	   If forgot something, go back and memorize. 

Todo: 
Revise the ex22 notes. 
Read code from github, bitbucket, etc.
	   
Notes:
Ex 20 -> could be new to Y.
